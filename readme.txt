== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. **Why should I submit my blog posts for editing and proofreading?**

   Your blog is a representation of yourself or your company, and you want to ensure it is the best it can possibly be. Simple mistakes can decrease your credibility and distract from your content. Our editors will be able to review your blog posts with a fresh and objective pair of eyes, eliminating any grammatical and spelling errors, and ensuring your meaning is clear.

2. **How do I set up an account?**

   Once your plugin is installed, go to the Settings area in your WordPress dashboard to sign up for an API key, and then you will be able to interact with us exclusively through our WordPress plugin. See http://www.scribendi.com/wordpress_plugin for complete details. With the click of a button, you can have your blog post edited in as little as a few hours.

   You can pay as you go using your credit card or PayPal account, or you can apply for a business/monthly billing account. Scribendi.com payments are secured with industry-standard levels of encryption.
